# planning

## first get HQ to LQ pipeline working

*## choose a model

- GAN
- HR (High-Resolution)
- Bicubic
- SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)
- EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution)
- RCAN (Residual Channel Attention Network)
- EnhanceNet
- SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)
- ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)



## evaluation

- they use psnr
