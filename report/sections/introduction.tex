The goal of this mini-challenge is to generate high-quality (HQ) face images from the
corrupted low-quality (LQ) ones (see Figure 1) [1]. The data for this task comes from
the FFHQ. For this challenge, we provide a mini dataset, which consists of 5000 HQ
images for training and 400 LQ-HQ image pairs for validation. Note that we do not
provide the LQ images in the training set.
